## Configuration

There are a number of configuration choices that allow you to customize your instance of Maitre-D.

| ENV | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | -- |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_NAME` | `auth_token` | The name of the cookie stored when a user logs in. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | - | A postgresql url. |
| `HARD_UNAUTH` | `false` | If set to `true`, unauthorized requests will receive a simple 401. Otherwise, unauthorized requests will redirect to the login form.
| `JWT_RSA_PEM` | - | An RSA 256 PEM private key. |
| `JWT_RSA_PUB` | - | An RSA 256 public key from the provided private key. |
| `SECURITY_TOKEN` | - | A secure token that is passed as a param when logging in a user from another platform. This token acts as an api key to allow authentication to happen elsewhere. |

## Bootstrapping User

In order to manage roles, you must first have a user with permission to manage roles. To create this user,
we have provided a hook based upon two ENV being set upon startup.

| ENV | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPERADMIN_USERNAME` | The username/email of the privileged user |
| `SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` | The password of the user |

The user is created or updated with the given username and password and is given the "manage_roles" role
which allows access to the management dashboard.

## Local Setup

You'll need the following to run the project yourself.

### PostgreSQL Database

This app uses [PostgreSQL 13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/) for it's datastore. In order to configure one, provide a database URL via an environment variable.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

This database can be setup in any fashion that you choose. Options include [local install](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres?tab=description), or as [a web service](https://www.heroku.com/postgres). If you'd like to use Docker, we have a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) [file](./docker-compose.yml) to help,

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env.development
# Add your custom choices for ENV
source .env.development
docker-compose up --detach db
```

### Docker

If you'd like to run the application using Docker, there is a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) provided.
To use, build the container first and then run it with your configured database and port settings.

```bash
source .env.development
docker build -t maitre-d .
docker run --rm -e DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL -p 3000:3000 maitre-d
